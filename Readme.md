# vue-esri-vuetify

I am trying to create an app with vue, vuetify and the the esri-javascript-api.

This is the best solution I have so far. It is created by first creating a vue/vuetify app and then 
applying the configuration from https://github.com/crackernutter/arcgis-webpack-vue-calcite .

I am not 100% happy with this solution, so any suggestions for improvement would be welcome.
